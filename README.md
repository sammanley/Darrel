# Darrel
Darrel is a moderately-simple web-scrapping Python3 script for phone numbers that was created by Samuel Manley AKA ImmaFish.
After the prerequisites, run Darrel.py, you will be prompted to input a URL. You will then be prompted to input the filename that you wish to save the phone numbers under.
Darrel will then scan the site for phone numbers.

## Dependencies

-python3
-requests

Make sure you have the most up-to-date version of Python3.

```sudo apt install python3```

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```pip install requests```

## Future updates
I intend on turning this into something of a project.
By the end of it, you can expect Darrel to be able to crawl all around the internet looking for phone numbers, and why stop at phone numbers?
